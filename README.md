# my-vim-setup

My vim setup, used primarily for gvim on Windows 10

I'm currently running vim74

Most of the files in this repo were not written by me.
The only file to which I made significant contributions is the \_vimrc,
which I still borrowed heavily from others

### Acknowledgements

#### My knowledge of Vim
I thank Steve Losh, author of [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/) for the wonderful introduction to Vimscript I experienced from his book.

#### Specific code sources
Unfortunately, I have not kept careful track of the sources of my code.
